1. Availability for meeting expectations
  Meet it person, but if you can't make it, then meet online. 3 daily sprint meetings per week for 15 minutes.

2. Response time to communication expectations
   Regular communication should occur every three days via discord. This communication should include a simple 
   update on ones progress of their portion of the project. If a member forgets to post progress, 
   any member can send an inquiry message to the person who forgot. 
   If the message is not responded to in 24 hours, the group will begin to take on that memberâ€Ÿs responsibilities through the
   decision making process stated in part six of this section.

3. Definition of done: when is a task complete? (hint: "I'm done with that but I didn't check it in to github" is not done.)
   The task is completed when the person assigned to the task commits to the branch and makes a pull request. Let two other people 
   review the code. If there is an issue, the assignee should make changes. If not, the task is done.

4. Scrum meeting format/frequency and distribution of documentation tasks (meeting minutes, updating task board)
   We will be meeting Monday and Tuesday from 3:30 to 3:45 online, if the meeting is in person it will be discussed beforehand where to meet.

5. Procedure for adopting policies (e.g. code style, code check-in steps, documentation updates)
   if you adopt such a policy during the initial meeting, put it here:
   1. All code that is written should be clean and easily readable by others, and each method that is implemented must be well documented. 
   2. All members are expected to accomplish their tasks on time and be ready/prepared for each sprint meeting.
   3. All code that is written should be at the same professional quality

6. Procedure for handling a member who is not meeting expectations
must include at least 3 actions before involving the instructor

7. Signatures: each member must sign their name by typing their name at the bottom of the document.
