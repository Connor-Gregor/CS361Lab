1. Availability for meeting expectations
  Meet it person, but if you can't make it, then meet online. 3 daily sprint meetings per week for 15 minutes.

2. Response time to communication expectations
   Regular communication should occur every three days via discord. This communication should include a simple 
   update on ones progress of their portion of the project. If a member forgets to post progress, 
   any member can send an inquiry message to the person who forgot. 
   If the message is not responded to in 24 hours, the group will begin to take on that member‟s responsibilities through the
   decision making process stated in part six of this section.

3. Definition of done: when is a task complete? (hint: "I'm done with that but I didn't check it in to github" is not done.)
   The task is completed when the person assigned to the task commits to the branch and makes a pull request. Let two other people 
   review the code. If there is an issue, the assignee should make changes. If not, the task is done.

4. Scrum meeting format/frequency and distribution of documentation tasks (meeting minutes, updating task board)
   We will be meeting Monday and Tuesday from 3:30 to 3:45 online, if the meeting is in person it will be discussed beforehand where to meet.

5. Procedure for adopting policies (e.g. code style, code check-in steps, documentation updates)
   if you adopt such a policy during the initial meeting, put it here:
   1. All code that is written should be clean and easily readable by others, and each method that is implemented must be well documented. 
   2. All members are expected to accomplish their tasks on time and be ready/prepared for each sprint meeting.
   3. All code that is written should be at the same professional quality

6. Procedure for handling a member who is not meeting expectations must include at least 3 actions before involving the instructor

     Minor Group Offence:
            A minor group offence occurs once one of the charter rules/statements have been broken. Trying to say
            a task is finished without submitting a pull request would be an example of a minor group offence.
            Once a member has aqcuired a minor group offence, then they will receive one strike, for not living
            up to the charters rules and regulations. If the member ammends their group offence by making up a 
            meeting or fixing a mistake in a task, then the strike will be waived. If the member does not do 
            anything to correct their strike, then it will be kept, and any subsequent strike from a minor group
            offence will result in an additional strike. After three strike have been accumulated, the member will
            end up receiving a major group offence. All strikes and reasons will be kept note off, by the scrum master.

     Major Group Offence:
            A major group offence occurs once there as been a substantial break has occured in the charter. For
            example, If a group member does not respond to messages for over a week. Another way to earn a major
            group offence would be if a member accumulates three or more strikes from minor group offences. 
            Once a member has received a major group offence, they will receive a probation, which will be noted
            by the scrum master to keep a record of the offence. If the member that received the probation is shown
            to improve their work efficacy and shows group initiative, then the scrum master may call for a group
            vote to decide if the member who earned probation, deserves to have their probation waived. If a member
            with probation ends up receiving another strike, then there will be a talk within the group whether
            the member deserves to be reassigned. If a member ends up receiving another major strike, whilst holding
            a probation, then they will immediately be called for reassignment.

       Reassignment:
            A group member committing enough minor and major offences will finally have gone to
            the dark side and demoted to Darth Vader. They will be referred to punishment and
            dismissal and will be given over to review by the TA and governing bodies (the Rock).
            An email describing the offences leading up to punishment and dismissal will be displayed 
            along with testimonies from at least 2 other group members and a log of
            offenses. If available, the offending members work will be confiscated and termed as
            “belonging to the group”.
