1. Availability for meeting expectations
  Meet it person, but if you can't make it, then meet online. 3 daily sprint meetings per week for 15 minutes.

2. Response time to communication expectations
   Regular communication should occur every three days via discord. This communication should include a simple 
   update on ones progress of their portion of the project. If a member forgets to post progress, 
   any member can send an inquiry message to the person who forgot. 
   If the message is not responded to in 24 hours, the group will begin to take on that member‟s responsibilities through the
   decision making process stated in part six of this section.

3. Definition of done: when is a task complete? (hint: "I'm done with that but I didn't check it in to github" is not done.)
   The task is completed when the person assigned to the task commits to the branch and makes a pull request. Let two other people 
   review the code. If there is an issue, the assignee should make changes. If not, the task is done.

4. Scrum meeting format/frequency and distribution of documentation tasks (meeting minutes, updating task board)
   We will be meeting Monday and Tuesday from 3:30 to 3:45 online, if the meeting is in person it will be discussed beforehand where to meet.

5. Procedure for adopting policies (e.g. code style, code check-in steps, documentation updates)
   if you adopt such a policy during the initial meeting, put it here:
   1. All code that is written should be clean and easily readable by others, and each method that is implemented must be well documented. 
   2. All members are expected to accomplish their tasks on time and be ready/prepared for each sprint meeting.
   3. All code that is written should be at the same professional quality

6. Procedure for handling a member who is not meeting expectations
must include at least 3 actions before involving the instructor
     Minor Group Offence:
            A minor group offence can occur for breaking indicated statutes of the charter. For example, missing a 
            meeting without prior notice or valid reason. Minor
            offences require the offender to be labeled as “Storm trooper” for their stupidity. The
            storm trooper is required to prepare a delicious baked treat good either homemade or
            store bought within the next two meetings. Failure to do so will escalate them to the next
            level of offence. A record of the minor offence and when the delicious baked treat arrived
            will be recorded by the group assigned note taker.
     Major Group Offence:
            A major group offence can occur by breaking indicated statutes of the charter, or for
            accumulation of 3 or more minor offences. Major offences require that the offender be
            labeled as “Anakin Skywalker” for his treachery. Anakin Skywalker is on probation and
            his probation status is to be clearly documented by email including a detailed description
            of his offence. Anakin Skywalker may return to regular group member status upon a
            group consensus. If Anakin Skywalker commits another offence constituted as either
            minor or major, he will become a candidate for punishment and dismissal.
       Punishment and Dismissal:
            A group member committing enough minor and major offences will finally have gone to
            the dark side and demoted to Darth Vader. They will be referred to punishment and
            dismissal and will be given over to review by the TA and governing bodies (the Rock).
            An email describing the offences leading up to punishment and dismissal will be displayed 
            along with testimonies from at least 2 other group members and a log of
            offenses. If available, the offending members work will be confiscated and termed as
            “belonging to the group”.


7. Signatures: each member must sign their name by typing their name at the bottom of the document.
